It is our name for the code and capabilities, including both web and desktop, that can be deployed and configured for a variety of needs.  For this frok of DIVE (DIVE-DSA)</p> <p>Detection - A single annotation.  A detection could be associated with a point in time within a track, or it could have no temporal association.</p> <p>Features - Bounding box, polygon, head/tail points or other visible elements of a detection.</p> <p>Track - A collection of detections spanned over multiple frames in a video or image sequence.  Tracks include a start and end time and can have gap periods in which no detections exist.</p> <p>Group - A collection of one or more tracks, which can be given a definite frame range, type annotation, confidence, and attributes.</p> <p>Types - Every track (or detection, if tracks aren't applicable) has one or more types that should be used to annotate the primary characteristic you are interested in classifying.  Types are typically used to train a single or multi-class classifier.  A track (or detection) may have multiple types with confidence values associated.</p> <p>Frame - A single image or point in time for a video or image sequence.</p> <p>Key Frame - Every manually drawn annotation is considered a keyframe, and all automated pipelines produce keyframes. Only keyframes can have attributes.  Key frame detections are differentiated from interpolated detections, which are the implicit bounding boxes you see when linear interpolation is enabled.</p> <p>Interpolation - The implicit bounding boxes between keyframes in a track.</p> <p>Attributes - Attributes are free-form secondary characteristics on both tracks and detections. For example, a <code>fish</code> type track may have an <code>is_adult</code> boolean attribute.</p>"},{"location":"Annotation-QuickStart/","title":"Annotation Quickstart","text":"<p>Before following the quickstart, it could be helpful to skim the User Interface Guide</p>"},{"location":"Annotation-QuickStart/#single-frame-detections","title":"Single Frame Detections","text":"<p>How to quickly create multiple detections on a single image frame.</p> <ol> <li>Click  (creation settings menu) in the Track List area.<ol> <li>From the Mode dropdown, choose Detection.</li> <li>From the Type dropdown, choose or enter a default name that all new detections will have.
